Welcome to TransitFit!
======================

``TransitFit`` is a Python 3.X package for fitting multi-telescope, multi-filter, and multi-epoch exoplanetary transit observations. It uses the `batman <https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~lkreidberg/batman/index.html>`_ transit model and nested sampling routines from `dynesty <https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

``TransitFit`` can include in its likelihood calculations the effect of host star characteristics and observation filter profiles on limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs), which we refer to as :ref:`'coupling' the LDCs <Limb-darkening>`. It can also perform per-telescope detrending simultaneously with the fitting of other parameters.

See :ref:`Getting Started` for instructions on how to use ``TransitFit``. You can also find more information in the `TransitFit paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210312139H/abstract>`_


Installation
============
``TransitFit`` is compatible with Python 3.X installations. To run, ``TransitFit`` requires the following packages:

* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* corner
* `batman <https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~lkreidberg/batman/index.html>`_
* `dynesty <https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
* `ldtk <https://github.com/hpparvi/ldtk>`_

You can install it direct from the source by downloading the project from the `GitHub page <https://github.com/joshjchayes/TransitFit>`_ and running::

    pip install .
    
or, 

    python setup.py install
